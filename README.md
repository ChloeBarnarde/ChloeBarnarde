# Hi, I'm Chloe

I'm a Comp Sci and Statistics Student. I partically enjoy making video games, and my prefered engine/language being Unity + C#.

## My Current WIP:
I'm currently working on a _very_ barebones RNN in C, its mostly as a learning oppurtinity to better understand both C, and how Reccurent Neural Networks work. It's been a lot of fun so far, and I can't wait to see how it turns out when its done.

## Currently Learning
- Lua - by making games in Pico8, a fantasy console**
- C - with the above project I've mentioned
